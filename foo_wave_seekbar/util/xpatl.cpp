// XPSupport ATL Wrappers (for VC2012 Update 2)
// Written by Mike Ryan (aka Ted.)
// http://tedwvc.wordpress.com

// 2013-04-14 1.00 initial release to wrap InitializeCriticalSectionEx
// 2013-04-15 1.01 added x64 asm file (no change to CPP file)
// 2013-04-17 1.02 cleaned up Vista check (was triggering RTCs)

#include <Windows.h>
#include <tchar.h>

// ATL stuff
